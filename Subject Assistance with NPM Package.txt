Subject: Assistance with NPM Package Upload Issue

Hello [Customer's Name],

Thank you for reaching out to Cloudsmith Support!

I’ve investigated the issue with your NPM package upload and identified a couple of problems in the package.json file that might be causing the synchronization failure:

Invalid "name" field – The name field is currently an empty list ([]). It should be a string that follows NPM naming conventions (e.g., "dummy-package").

Incorrect "version" format – The version field is set to "244", which does not follow the semantic versioning format (x.y.z). It should be something like "2.4.4".

To resolve this, please update your package.json file as follows:

{
  "name": "dummy-package",
  "version": "2.4.4",
  ...
}

Once you've corrected these fields, try re-uploading the package to Cloudsmith. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to reach out, and we'd be happy to assist!

Best regards,
Cloudsmith Support
